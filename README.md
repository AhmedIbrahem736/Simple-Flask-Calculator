# Simple-Flask-Calculator
A simple flask calculator app that does the basic arithmetic operations, such as:
- Addition
- Subtraction

- Division

It consists of 2 pages:
- Index page, where you can enter 2 values and choose the arithmetic operation.
- Result page, where you can see the result of your arithmetic operation.
